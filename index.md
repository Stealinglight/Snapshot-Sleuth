# Snapshot-Sleuth

**Serverless Forensic Automation System**

A production-grade system for automated forensic analysis of EBS snapshots using AWS serverless services. Built to transform incident response from hours of manual work to minutes of automated processing.

## Key Results

- **71% faster** forensic processing
- **150+ hours** of analyst time recovered
- **100+ snapshots** analyzed across 50+ incidents
- **16 CDK stacks** deployed across 20+ regions

## Architecture Highlights

- **Event-driven ingestion** with EventBridge and SQS
- **Hybrid compute** combining Lambda orchestration with EC2 forensics
- **Multi-tool scanning** with YARA, ClamAV, and custom artifact collectors
- **Real-time dashboards** for workflow visibility
